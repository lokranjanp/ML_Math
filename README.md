# Math_in_ML

Goal : To understand the basic math concepts used in basic Machine Learning Algorithms.

## 1. Linear Algebra
## 2. Calculus
## 3. Probability
## 4. Statistics

The above concepts will be implemented in scratch using Numpy only.
Later pre-existing libraries like tf, torch will be used to implement the same.

Notes to answer questions like why, how, usecase, advantages will be added alongside the practical implementation.
Feel free to raise issues if any problems are found on the implementation.
